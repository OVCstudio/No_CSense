# No_CSense
To the GitHub Support Team:  

### Background  
In early 2025, a plugin named "CSense" spread rapidly across the "共创世界" (Co-Creation World, hereafter "CCW"; official site: ccw.site) programming community. It was published by an account I reported.  
Two versions exist:  
- An anonymously released **closed-source version** (https://github.com/axolotlTFGS/CSense)  
- A later **open-source version** (https://github.com/FurryR/CSense)  

On **January 11, 2025, at 20:55 Beijing Time**, the author posted an article on CCW’s forum, using third-person narrative to claim they had "turned themselves in." If true, who maintains the open-source repository? (Its last update was **April 13, 2025, at 12:09 Beijing Time**.)  

### Harm Caused by the Plugin  
This plugin enables users to become "emperors" of the community by exploiting backend vulnerabilities in CCW’s poorly secured systems.  
The closed-source repository’s description (though indirect) boils down to:  
- *"Log into others’ accounts without passwords"* (Account theft)  
- *"Download closed-source CCW projects, monitor/modify/lock clone variables"* (Copyright infringement; data manipulation)  
- *"Alter databases and leaderboards"* (Falsifying records)  
- *"Execute contract rules to extract/inject assets into coin pools"* (Sabotaging virtual economies)  
- *"Control MMO rooms"* (Ruining others’ gameplay)  

**This is not an "审计工具/audit tool"**
# —it is malware designed to tamper with server data.  

These actions violate **GitHub’s Acceptable Use Policy**, Section 1:  
> *"You must comply with all applicable laws"* ([English](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies#1-compliance-with-laws-and-regulations) | [中文](https://docs.github.com/zh/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies#1-%E9%81%B5%E5%AE%88%E6%B3%95%E5%BE%8B%E5%92%8C%E6%B3%95%E8%A7%84)).  
The author has demonstrably breached **Chinese criminal law**. The closed-source version’s CC0 1.0 license exacerbates harm by allowing unrestricted modification, wholly failing to "prevent abuse."  

### Flawed Justifications  
On **January 11, 2025, at 15:20 Beijing Time**, the author exploited CCW’s backend to publish a platform-wide article (using 9 tags instead of the standard 3; archived [here](https://archive.is/YNyP2)). It was swiftly removed by CCW, prompting the author to repost it on GitHub.  

In the closed-source "FAQ" ([link](https://github.com/axolotlTFGS/CSense/blob/main/FAQ.md)), the author baselessly claims:  
> **"CCW 不是非营利性组织，他们通过建立同政府及教育机构的合作、吸引风险投资，以及向网课机构引流/反哺来获得利益。"**  
*(CCW is not a non-profit; it profits through government/education partnerships, venture capital, and funneling users to paid courses.)*  

While CCW’s Gandi IDE (a Scratch-based editor) improperly reused **"TurboWarp’s uncredited source code"**, CSense **breaks the law**. Exposing CCW’s flaws does not justify illegal means. The author treats GitHub not as a legitimate platform, but as a **lawless zone within China’s internet**.  

### Why Only Report the Closed-Source Version?  
Most abusers are "script kiddies." The closed-source version works out-of-the-box, while the open-source version’s compilation steps deter casual users. Removing the closed-source version allows CCW’s team to analyze threats without enabling immediate misuse.  

### Why Removing CSense Matters  
The open-source repository states:  
> **”CSense 指出的漏洞不是前端修一修就能解决的。请好好反思自己的后端到底烂成什么样子，能让 CSense 骑在脸上开大。“**  
*”The vulnerabilities CSense exposes can’t be fixed by frontend patches. Reflect on how your rotten backend lets CSense run rampant.“*  

CCW’s flawed backend makes mitigating CSense difficult. With CCW currently hosting a Game Jam, **we urge GitHub to remove the open-source CSense repository** to restore a safe community environment.
